As we need to develop website which supports IE8, and with the ant design, I decided to develop a sort of plugins based on bootstrap 3.3.7 and jquery 1.12.4 to fufill the demands.

I also use the ES6 synax to develop and degrade the ES6 to ES3 for running on IE8 platform.

Now I have developed plugins, as below, with ant design style and bootstrap's programming.
 
I will update this project soon.
